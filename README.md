# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Customer Lifetime Value Prediction** project leverages machine learning models to predict the future profitability of customers based on their transactional behavior and demographic data. This project aims to help businesses identify high-value customers and optimize marketing strategies.

## 🚀 Features
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- CLV Prediction using Regression Models
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- Visualization of CLV Distribution
- Hyperparameter Tuning

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit (for interactive dashboards)

## 🔑 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Lifetime-Value.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Customer-Lifetime-Value

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📄 Usage
1. Upload customer transaction data in CSV format.
2. Perform data cleaning and transformation.
3. Visualize customer purchase frequency and revenue patterns.
4. Train machine learning models to predict CLV.
5. Interpret the results using graphs and charts.


## 📌 Model Details
